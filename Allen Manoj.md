# Machine Learning

Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

> Machine Learning is the science of getting computers to learn and act like humans do, and improve their learning over time in autonomous fashion, by feeding them data and information in the form of observations and real-world interactions.

## Supervised Learning

> Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.

Supervised machine learning algorithms are designed to learn by example. The name “supervised” learning originates from the idea that training this type of algorithm is like having a teacher supervise the whole process. Supervised learning is the most popular paradigm for machine learning. It is the easiest to understand and the simplest to implement.
 
 
#### Why is Supervised Learning used?

Supervised learning allows collecting data and produce  data output from the previous experiences.
Helps to optimize performance criteria with the help of experience.
Supervised machine learning helps to solve various types of real-world computation problems.
